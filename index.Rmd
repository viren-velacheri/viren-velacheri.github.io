# Welcome! I am Viren Velacheri
  
</br>

##### I am a senior Computer science student here at UT Austin.

##### Outside of programming and school, I love hanging out with friends and family.

##### I also enjoy the outdoors, particularly sports (soccer, football, basketball, and swimming) to name a few  

##### I don't have any data-related projects either, but if I did you could find them [here](portfolio.html)!
